## Introduction of the Company and Research Problem  

Company X is an electricity sales company that needs **to forecast electricity consumption in Estonia at the hourly level** in order to support electricity planning and purchasing decisions.  

## Research plan

1. **Analyze correlation:** Examine the relationship between electricity consumption and temperature using historical data.
2. **Build forecast:** Develop an **hourly** electricity consumption forecast model.
3. **Validate:** Test the forecast **against actuals** and assess accuracy.

## Data protection description – on what basis are the data processed?

## Business glossary, data model, data dictionary

### 1. Business Glossary

- **Electricity Consumption (MWh)** – Hourly electricity demand in megawatt-hours, measured by Elering.  
- **Temperature (°C)** – Hourly outdoor air temperature from Meteostat or University of Tartu station.  
- **15-Minute Measurement** – Underlying measurement interval for actual load, aggregated to hourly for forecasting.  
- **Regression Model** – Statistical model linking consumption with temperature.  
- **ARIMA Model** – Alternative time-series model considered for comparison.  
- **Bias Coefficient** – Seasonal correction factor applied to regression forecasts.  
- **Growth Coefficient** – Baseline trend showing long-term consumption growth.  
- **Day-Curve Profile** – 24-hour consumption distribution expressed as percentages.  
- **Workday Profile** – Daily curve for weekdays.  
- **Offday Profile** – Daily curve for weekends and holidays.  
- **Forecast Horizon** – Prediction window, 7 days ahead.  
- **date_local** – Local forecast date (Europe/Tallinn).  
- **datetime_local** – Local timestamp for forecasted hour.  
- **consumption_hourly** – Hourly forecast consumption in MWh.  
- **weekday** – Day of week (0=Mon..6=Sun).  
- **hour_local** – Hour of day in local time.  
- **segment** – Classification: workday, weekend, holiday.  
- **season** – Season of year.  
- **is_weekend** – Weekend flag.  
- **is_holiday** – Holiday flag.  
- **month_num** – Month number.  
- **EE_avg_temp_C** – Average daily temperature.  
- **bias_key** – Key for bias factor.  
- **bias_factor** – Bias correction value.  
- **yhat_base** – Baseline forecast.  
- **yhat_consumption** – Final forecast.  
- **DataFrame** – Python tabular data structure.  
- **ETL** – Extract, Transform, Load process.  
- **Stand-up Meeting** – Daily coordination meeting.  
- **Product Owner** – Role responsible for planning.  
- **Tester** – Role verifying code before merging.

### 2. Data Model (verbal explanation)

See the **DAta model diagram and Data flow** in the dedicated section below.  
The logical structure can be described as follows:

- **Input layer**: Electricity consumption (Elering JSON/CSV) and temperature data (Meteostat API, Tartu University CSV).  
- **Transformation layer**: Data cleaning, time standardization (Europe/Tallinn), derived columns (`weekday`, `season`, `growth coefficient`).  
- **Model layer**: Regression model linking temperature with consumption, corrected by seasonal *bias coefficients*.  
- **Profile layer**: Daily consumption curves (workday, weekend, holiday) providing *hourly distribution coefficients*.  
- **Forecast layer**: Daily forecast values are distributed into hourly forecasts using the profiles.  
- **Output layer**: Final 7-day forecast table containing hourly consumption (`consumption_hourly`) and supporting metadata (`segment`, `season`, `bias_factor`, etc.).
