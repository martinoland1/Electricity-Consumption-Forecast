## Introduction of the Company and Research Problem  

Company X is an electricity sales company that needs **to forecast electricity consumption in Estonia at the hourly level** in order to support electricity planning and purchasing decisions.  

## Research plan

1. **Analyze correlation:** Examine the relationship between electricity consumption and temperature using historical data.
2. **Build forecast:** Develop an **hourly** electricity consumption forecast model.

### 2. Data Model (verbal explanation)

See the **DAta model diagram and Data flow** in the dedicated section below.  
The logical structure can be described as follows:

- **Input layer**: Electricity consumption (Elering JSON/CSV) and temperature data (Meteostat API, Tartu University CSV).  
- **Transformation layer**: Data cleaning, time standardization (Europe/Tallinn), derived columns (`weekday`, `season`, `growth coefficient`).  
- **Model layer**: Regression model linking temperature with consumption, corrected by seasonal *bias coefficients*.  
- **Profile layer**: Daily consumption curves (workday, weekend, holiday) providing *hourly distribution coefficients*.  
- **Forecast layer**: Daily forecast values are distributed into hourly forecasts using the profiles.  
- **Output layer**: Final 7-day forecast table containing hourly consumption (`consumption_hourly`) and supporting metadata (`segment`, `season`, `bias_factor`, etc.).

### Forecasting Pipeline Overview
The model integrates electricity consumption data from Elering and weather information from Meteostat into a combined dataframe. This serves as the central input for the forecasting pipeline:
- A regression formula is applied to capture the relationship between daily average temperature and electricity consumption.
- A bias correction module adjusts the regression output to reduce systematic errors (e.g., seasonal or structural effects).
- A weekday profile provides the hourly load distribution, refining daily forecasts into hourly demand curves.
- The pipeline first produces a daily forecast and then disaggregates it into an hourly forecast using the weekday/hourly patterns.

## Data quality check

## Exploratory data analysis
### 1. Yearly consumption and average temperature
This chart shows the total electricity consumption per year alongside the average air temperature.
- From 2020 to 2024, consumption remained relatively stable around 8 million MWh, while temperatures varied.
- The highest consumption was observed in 2021 (8.4M MWh).
- Data for 2025 is currently incomplete, showing a lower total (5.6M MWh).
- In general, colder years correspond with higher electricity usage.

### 2. Monthly consumption and temperature
This visualization illustrates the relationship between consumption and temperature on a monthly level.
- Winter months (Decemberâ€“February): higher consumption due to heating demand, with temperatures dropping below zero.
- Summer months (Juneâ€“August): consumption decreases, while average temperatures peak at 16â€“19 Â°C.
- The inverse relationship is clear â€“ colder months drive higher demand, warmer months lower demand.
<img width="1381" height="741" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bcdd81e-6dc6-42d9-834e-b0491fef6d34" />

### 3. Year-to-year comparison (2023 vs 2024)
This comparison highlights monthly consumption and temperatures across two consecutive years.
- Both years show the same seasonal pattern: higher demand in winter, lower in summer.
- Temperatures follow a similar curve, but January 2023 was colder than January 2024.
- The comparison suggests that even small differences in temperature (e.g., colder January) can cause significant changes in electricity demand.
<img width="1318" height="741" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b79b65a-62d8-434c-a092-94caa9d7e0e8" />

### 4. Average consumption daily profile
Daily Consumption Profiles (by Day of the Week)
This visualization shows the average daily consumption patterns broken down by each day of the week.
- The chart highlights how electricity usage typically evolves hour by hour across weekdays and weekends:
- Workdays (Monâ€“Fri) follow a consistent pattern, with a clear morning peak (around 7â€“10 AM) and a gradual evening decline.
- Saturdays display a flatter profile, with less pronounced peaks, indicating more evenly distributed consumption throughout the day.
- Sundays show the lowest overall demand, especially during the morning hours, reflecting reduced industrial and commercial activity.
- This analysis provides insights into behavioral and operational differences between weekdays and weekends, which is essential for forecasting hourly demand and adjusting models for different calendar profiles.

## Statistical data analysis
### Regression Analysis (Daily Consumption vs. Temperature)
We fitted linear regression models to study the relationship between average daily temperature and electricity consumption in Estonia.
All Days: A strong negative correlation was observed between temperature and consumption. As temperature rises, electricity usage decreases, reflecting reduced heating demand. (Slope â‰ˆ â€“395 MWh/Â°C, RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.75).
Workdays (Monâ€“Fri, non-holiday): The model shows an even stronger relationship (Slope â‰ˆ â€“404 MWh/Â°C, RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.82), indicating that weekday consumption patterns are highly temperature-dependent.
Weekends & Holidays: The slope is slightly lower (â‰ˆ â€“382 MWh/Â°C, RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.81), but the correlation remains strong, showing that leisure days also follow the same inverse trend.
These models will later be integrated into the forecasting pipeline, where the segmented regressions (workdays vs. weekends/holidays) allow us to capture different behavioral patterns and improve accuracy in consumption prediction.

### Bias calculation
Seasonal Bias Correction Factors
To further refine forecasts, we computed bias correction factors by season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).
Spring (Marchâ€“May) and Autumn (Septemberâ€“November): Transitional periods, where actual consumption often deviates from regression estimates due to rapid shifts in heating/cooling needs.
Winter (Decemberâ€“February): Highest bias adjustments, since cold extremes drive significantly higher electricity usage than predicted by a simple linear trend.
Summer (Juneâ€“August): Lowest adjustments, as electricity consumption stabilizes and is less variable with temperature.
These factors are applied as multipliers to regression-based forecasts, either by season or by month, and can be segmented further into workdays vs. off-days.
<img width="989" height="390" alt="bias" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0847b029-2811-4cfe-bb61-a21c8af894e6" />

### Weekday Load Profiles (24Ã—7 Hourly Share Matrix)

We analyzed the average daily consumption patterns across weekdays by building a 24Ã—7 share matrix. Each column (weekday) sums to 1.0, showing how electricity demand is distributed across the 24 hours of the day.
Key insights:
Early morning (0â€“5h): Lowest relative consumption across all weekdays (~3â€“3.5% of daily total per hour).
Morning ramp-up (6â€“9h): Sharp increase, peaking around 8â€“10h (up to ~5% of daily total per hour), especially on workdays.
Daytime plateau (10â€“16h): Stable, elevated demand throughout business hours.
Evening peak (18â€“21h): Second wave of demand, stronger on weekends, reflecting household activity.
Weekday vs Weekend: Weekdays show stronger morning peaks due to industrial and office usage, while weekends flatten daytime demand and shift load toward later hours.
This matrix is DST-aware and based on the Europe/Tallinn timezone, with public holidays excluded from the training sample. It is later used to adjust hourly forecast distributions once daily consumption is predicted.
