## Introduction of the Company and Research Problem  

Company X is an electricity sales company that needs to forecast electricity consumption in Estonia at the **monthly, daily, and hourly level** in order to support electricity purchasing and planning decisions.  

The research problem is twofold:  

### Part 1. Identifying the drivers of electricity consumption in Estonia

The aim is to understand which factors influence electricity demand, such as:  
- **Weather conditions** – temperature, precipitation, wind speed, solar radiation  
- **Calendar effects** – month, day of the week (working day, weekend, public holiday)  
- **Other external factors** – X (to be identified during the analysis)  

### Part 2. Forecasting electricity consumption  
Based on the identified drivers, the goal is to produce a **forecast of electricity consumption for October 2025**, broken down into months, days, and hours.
